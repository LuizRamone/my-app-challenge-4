The next level of server abstraction for me is like a hybrid server approach to handle your main api requests with a traditional server, and the heavier tasks to a serverless platform to increase the performance,
in terms of optimization it will all be automatic with machine learning cutting up large programs into smaller pieces that can execute in separate cloud functions, and giving details how to keep high availability and low costs while achieving the best performance objectives.in my opinion the web apps will be deployed and managed inside every IDE, which you could easily configure and test at runtime without the need to upload the application in the cloud and wait for the pipeline to end, i think that kubernetes will still be used, but other applications with less "generic" concepts for specific apps like event-driven it will be more and more focused on that unique configuration,
and these apps will be used as another layer to the kubernetes/Docker Swarm abstractions, using these alternatives will improve how we develop and operate cloud applications in the years to come
