# Question
Systems like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are the end result of years and years of effort spent slowly abstracting server resources from being "a single physical machine your app is running on" to "a distributed pool of generic resources any app can run on." What do you think the next level of server abstraction will look like in 10 years? How will web apps be deployed and managed a decade from now? Will container management systems such as Kubernetes still be used, or will there be another layer of abstraction used?

# Answer of the 4th question
1- The next level of server abstraction for me is like a hybrid server approach to handle your main api requests with a traditional server, and the heavier tasks to a serverless platform to increase the performance, together with the usage of Unified kernels for containerization which is a hybrid of VMs and containers that you will improved security and agility than we have in both container and VMs. Instead of the shared operating systems and Kernels like we have in containers, Unified kernels will packages application images with an operating system, its own Kernel, and all other relevant dependencies required to run in different environments. this kernels images are highly optimized with smaller footprints and can boot faster than containers because they contain all necessary dependencies, also we will have more adoption in this new server abstraction to manage edge computing and internet of things applications, to provide the simplicity and lightweight needed for edge computing to work properly.

2- The web apps will be deployed and managed inside an IDE like enviroment built to run/compile every language possible, the deployment it will all be automatic with machine learning cutting up large applications into smaller pieces that can execute in separate cloud functions, and giving details how to keep high availability and low costs while achieving the best performance objectives which you could easily configure and test at runtime at any enviroment without the need to upload the application in the cloud and wait for the pipeline to end.

3- Kubernetes is one of the fastest-growing and most popular open source software projects in history, now its functionalities has expanded to the point it handles just about everything in our new, modern, cloud-native computing cloudscape and a decade from now, i think that kubernetes will still be used, but other applications with less "generic" concepts for specific apps like event-driven software it will be more and more focused on their unique configuration, Kubernetes and docker swarm will become a control plane for abstractions the custom resource definitions of these abstractions is what developers will be focus on, and these spefics apps will be used as another layer to the kubernetes/Docker Swarm abstractions, using these alternatives will improve how we develop and operate cloud applications in the years to come.
